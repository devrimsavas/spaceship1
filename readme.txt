this demonstrates a spaceship class which has some methods and attributes. You can create a new ship, fill the tanks, assign pilot and launch. When we create some class which will be used in our program, we can use our abstraction and imagination power. You can create everything with different methods, attributes. It is totally up to your imaginary. 
Program uses console interface. From menu you can enter different commands. A ship without pilot and unsufficient fuel will not be launched. you can see you hangar, fill and refill tanks. 

Issues: There is not critic  issue for this small program. But It is possible to add some GUI which simulates old times nasa terminal. I have already written a huge program which you can produce ship and discover many planetes. After debugging i will publish it too. Try to understand class concept rest is only your imagination.
